                We had been neighbours for five years, yet we had never really seen each other before. The first time I saw her was from the terrace of my house. I had gone there to carry out the task assigned by our Prime Minister at 5 p.m. It was a gesture of respect for the workers fighting against COVID-19 – to either clap or beat a plate in solidarity. 
That was when I noticed her. She was also on her terrace, looking at me. Our eyes met, and for a moment, I thought she was searching for something—or perhaps someone—in my gaze. And so, my story of "love or confusion" began. 
From that day onwards, we both started visiting our roofs routinely. It became a daily ritual, always at the same time. I found myself desperate to speak to her, and I could tell she knew this. But neither of us could do anything. The timing was never right—our families were always around, and it wasn’t appropriate to strike up a conversation then. 
One evening, however, I decided to take a chance. I went to the roof at 9 p.m., just because the weather was pleasant. When I reached the roof, she was already there. I realized that this was my opportunity. My heart pounded as I grew nervous. But then, I told myself that if I didn’t take this chance, she might think I was too shy. I took a deep breath and said, “Hello.” She turned toward me and smiled, replying with a simple “Hi.” 
I couldn’t resist. I told her how pretty I thought she was and how much I admired her. She thanked me shyly. Then I asked, “What’s your name?” She hesitated, and I could barely hear her answer. I asked again, and she finally replied, “Sabina.” 
“What a cute name,” I said with a smile. She blushed and thanked me again.
<br>
It was difficult to talk from one roof to another, and we had to keep our voices low so that no one would overhear us. Still, I gathered the courage to ask for her Instagram or Facebook ID. She gave it to me, and as she was about to leave, she said, “Bye, and good night.” As she went downstairs, I felt a surge of happiness. That was my first achievement. I couldn’t contain my excitement and shouted, “Hurray!” My mom, hearing the noise, called out, “Are you okay?” 
I quickly replied, “Yeah, Mom, I’m fine,” and then rushed to my phone. I searched for her ID and sent her a follow request. Within 
<br>
moments, she accepted, and I sent her a simple “Hello.”  <br>

She replied almost instantly with a “Hi.”
<br>
Our conversation started casually. I introduced myself as a 10thgrade student, and she responded with a laughing emoji. “Why are you laughing?” I asked. “Is it funny to be in 10th grade?” “No, I didn’t mean that,” she replied, still smiling. 
“Then what do you mean?” I asked, confused. 
<br>
She wrote, “Abhi tum bache ho, main tumse kaafi badi hoon.” I was stunned for a moment. It took me a couple of minutes to process it. 
That’s when my friend Harry, who had been laughing at the conversation, suggested we go for a walk and grab some soft drinks. As we walked, Harry began telling me a funny story of his own. Harry was a shy guy with his family, but when it came to girls, he acted completely differently. If he saw a girl, he’d follow her, and if she smiled at him, he’d imagine becoming her groom one day. He told me he was in love with someone and had even proposed to her. “Did she accept your proposal?” I asked. 
“No,” he replied. “Why?” I pressed. <br>
“Because we’ve never met,” he said, as if that wasn’t the biggest hurdle. <br>
I was shocked. “Wait, wait! You’ve never met her?” I asked, still in disbelief. <br>
“No,” he replied. <br>
“What’s wrong with you, Harry? Have you gone mad?” I exclaimed. “How could you propose to someone you’ve never even met?” “But we’ve been talking for a year,” he replied with a wink. 
“Then what did you do next?” I asked. <br>
“I decided I had to meet her, no matter what,” he answered confidently. <br>
“Have you met her yet?” I asked with curiosity. <br>
“Wait, wait. First, let’s buy some cold drinks,” he said, laughing. “I’ll tell you everything after that.” 
We bought our drinks, and Harry continued. He told me how he was determined to meet her but didn’t know how to convince his parents to let him go to West Bengal. He didn’t have enough money for the trip, so he sold his laptop for 20,000 rupees. 
“Are you insane?” I interrupted him. “It was worth 40,000 rupees!” “Yeah, but when I commit to something, no one can stop me!” he said with a sense of pride. 
I was speechless, but then I had an idea. My school was planning a six-day trip to Delhi, so I told my parents I wanted to go. I needed 5,000 rupees for the trip, and they gave it to me. I packed my bag, but instead of going to school, I took a train from Patna to Cooch Behar. 
When I arrived early in the morning, I was mesmerized by the beauty of the place. I sat at a small tea shop near the station, ordered a cup of tea, and messaged Sabina to ask where she lived in Cooch Behar. 
A few minutes later, she replied, asking why I wanted to know. I told her, “I’m in Cooch Behar.” 
“What? Why did you come here?” she asked, confused. <br>
“I came here to meet you,” I replied. “You said you couldn’t accept my proposal because we had never met, so now let’s meet!” “What? Have you gone mad? You came here just to meet me?” she replied angrily. 
“No,” I said, “I didn’t just come here to meet you. I came here to marry you.” 
She blocked me immediately. <br>
I stood there, stunned and speechless, trying to process what had just happened. 
Suddenly, I burst into laughter. I couldn’t stop. I laughed for five minutes, rolling on the floor. Harry tried to stop me, but every time I saw his face, I laughed even harder. Eventually, I stopped, and we started drinking our soft drinks in silence. 
Then, out of nowhere, I felt like I was falling. I heard someone calling my name, and I felt the earth shaking beneath me. It was as if I was falling from great heights. 
I woke up with a jolt, drenched in sweat. I was in my bed. My mom stood by my side and said, “It’s 10 a.m. Why are you still sleeping?” I took a deep breath, smiled at her, and said, “Why did you wake me up? I was in the middle of a beautiful dream.” 
Dreams, after all, are the golden life we long to live every day. In dreams, we are the kings, free from the sorrows of the real world.
