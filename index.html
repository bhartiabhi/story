Hey there, reader!  Before you dive in, let’s get one thing straight this is a fictional story. Any similarities to real people or situations are purely coincidental (or maybe you just have really bad luck in love).
If you’ve ever been a backup plan, an emotional support system for someone “confused,” or told to “move on” right after getting attached—don’t worry, you’re not alone. 
So, sit back, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the drama. Just remember: if they keep running back to their ex… you were never the main character.</h3> </p> <br> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> <h4>
Raghav was never that kind of man who had believed in love at first sight. He believed love was something that developed over a period, something which required patience and understanding. But then Sneha entered his life, and overnight, all his beliefs seemed so naive.

She wasn't just some girl in college; she was the type of girl who made a room light up if she was in it. Her laughter tended to linger in his thoughts after she left. She was bright, quirky, and very, very interesting.
And totally out of reach.  </p><br>


She was dating someone. <br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


The truth dawned on Raghav like a frosty wave, but he knew better than to linger on the impossible. He told himself that friendship was enough. That life and dream late-night talks meant nothing more than mutual companionship. That the smile she flashed him was simply her way of being friendly.

But destiny had other plans. <br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

One morning, suddenly, she called him. Her voice was shaking.
<br> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

"Can we meet?"
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

He saw her and she looked… shattered. Her sparkle was gone, replaced by red, tear-streaming eyes and a quivering voice.
<br> <br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

"It's not working with Nigam," she stammered, and then, like that, she fell into his arms, weeping.
<br><br> <p>&nbsp;</p>


Raghav held her, soothed her, promised her that everything would be alright. And in that instant, something changed. Something he couldn't quite put his finger on, but it mattered.


The late-night talks grew longer. The texts came more often. The gap between them disappeared, until one day she informed him that she had finally ended things with Nigam.

That was when Raghav felt it—hope.

For the first time, it felt like she was his, like this wasn't a friendship pose as something more. She held onto him now, called him for every little thing, laughed a little harder at his jokes, and stayed a little closer when they walked together side by side. He felt special. Needed.

Next came the semester holiday. 
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

They decided to go back home together. Raghav even changed his initial ticket just to get another one with Sneha in the same train.

Within the compartment, curtains pulled down, they chatted continuously. Nothing seemed to go wrong in the world. Then suddenly, from out of nowhere, she mentioned something that made a shiver run down his spine.
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

"Nigam has been trying to reach me again." 
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

Raghav's heart tightened. He smiled. "Then block him."
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

She paused, and then nodded slightly. "There's no need."
<br><br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

Two small words. But they felt like a knife to his chest. <br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

His expression dropped; his words stuck in his throat. The warmth was gone between them. She saw that. She always did.

Without warning, she moved forward, embracing him and whispering, "Please, Raghav… let go. At home, let's not talk much. It'll help you move on."
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

Move on? 
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>
The words haunted him like a bitter joke. Wasn't she the one who had drawn him in? Wasn't she the one who had led him to believe that there was something between them? 

But perhaps he had gotten it all wrong. 
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

Then things altered. Their dialogues reduced to near zero. Weeks became days. He instructed himself that he had to forget her. He had to wipe out her presence from his existence.

And then, on his birthday, she appeared.
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

A radiant smile, a well-packaged box.
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

It was a little thing, but to Raghav, it meant the world. Perhaps this was her way of telling him that she still loved him. Perhaps, just perhaps, things could return to normal.

Then there was the day that broke it all. 
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

They were walking through a mall, talking, laughing like they used to. And then, in an instant, her whole attitude changed.

She stopped dead in her tracks. Her face paled.
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

Raghav turned to look in the direction she was staring.
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Nigam!..... </b></p>
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

Panic danced on her face as she whirled to him, voice desperate. "Raghav, go. Now."
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

His gut fell. She didn't even let him respond, question. Like that, she erased him from the moment, as if he was never meant to be there.
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

Hurt and confused, he turned away. But deep within, he already knew—she had returned to Nigam.
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

When he met her later, she wove a tragic story.
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

"Nigam has been blackmailing me… he has some sensitive photos of mine. I have to remain close to him until I can access his phone and erase them."
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

Raghav wanted to believe her. He wanted to believe that he hadn't just been a passing distraction for her.
But something didn't feel right.

he believed in her, even when he did not want to. It had been just a few days that it had happened when,
one day, Sneha asked Raghav's phone and started deleting their conversations—one at a time.
He had no idea why, but he decided to keep quiet.
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>
Days passed, and then, gradually, she began closing him out, turning the door on him, piece by piece, until there was only silence.
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>
He tried calling her, but her number was blocked too. With no way to reach her, he turned to their mutual friend, Ragini. Desperate for answers.
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>
He called and told her everything. She listened,
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>
Then said, 'Wait, let me talk to Sneha and confirm.'
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>
Days passed. Raghav, drowning in confusion and sadness, struggled to make sense of it all. The weight of silence crushed him, even triggering a panic attack. Yet, Ragini never called back. He didn’t stop. He kept calling her, hoping to understand, to get some closure.
And then, one day, she finally called—asking him to meet. When they met, she didn’t say much, but her words carried an unspoken truth. She wasn’t telling him directly, but the message was clear—he needed to move on.
And just like that, the silence became deafening
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

Raghav looked at Ragini, his voice trembling with desperation. 'Will you just tell me everything straight? Please… just say it. My mind is breaking apart.'
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>
Raghav looked at Ragini, his voice trembling with desperation. 
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>
'Will you just tell me everything straight? Please… just say it.
My mind is breaking apart.
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

He was exhausted—completely lost in the storm of confusion. Nothing made sense anymore. The silence, the
distance, the unanswered questions—it was all too much. His heart raced, his thoughts tangled, and for the first time, he felt truly helpless.
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>

Ragini paused, taking a deep breath and choosing her words carefully. She had gotten the picture, but it felt even more burdensome to say aloud. She regarded Raghav's agitated eyes before speaking at last.
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>
"Raghav." 
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>
She hesitated, pausing for a moment, "sometimes we continue searching for answers that already stand before us. Perhaps. you simply refuse to see them"
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>
"What do you mean ?" Raghav asked her with his thoughts tangled.
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>
"She lied to you, Raghav. No pictures. No blackmail. She was never going to pick you."
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>
And like that, the fantasy fell apart.
<br> <p>&nbsp;</p>
Raghav saw the reality—he had been just an escape for her, a temporary solace. A moment in her life that she had no plans on keeping.
And so, he left.Not only from her, but from the version of himself that at one time or another used to think love in its raw form could redevelop someone's heart.

There are some love stories that don't need to be written.
And this was one of those things.
